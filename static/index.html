    <h3 class="text-grey">Installation Process</h3>
    <p>The <span class="text-primary">Recollector</span> implantation process employs neurosurgical precision.</p>
    <p>A team of skilled professionals utilizes robotic-assisted surgery to precisely insert the ultra-thin,
        biocompatible chip into the brain's neural cortex. The chip interfaces with neural synapses, establishing a
        secure connection while minimizing disruption to surrounding tissues.</p>
    <p>Post-implantation, the device integrates with the brain's neurochemistry, ensuring compatibility and long-term
        stability.</p>

            <h3 class="text-grey">The Saving feature</h3>
            <p>The <span class="text-primary">Recollector</span> operates on the principles of neuroprosthetics,
                employing an
                array of microsensors to detect and record neural activity associated with memory formation. These
                sensors
                capture intricate details such as synaptic firing patterns, neurotransmitter release, and neural network
                connectivity.</p>
            <p>The collected data undergoes real-time processing within the implanted chip, where it is converted into a
                proprietary digital memory format. This format allows for efficient storage and seamless transmission to
                the
                <span class="text-primary">Kandel Cloud</span> via a secure, high-bandwidth neural interface.</p>
            <p>The process ensures minimal latency and high-fidelity reproduction of memories.</p>

    <h3 class="text-grey">Memory Erasure</h3>
    <p>Memory management involves targeted manipulation of neural pathways. The <span
            class="text-primary">Recollector</span> employs advanced neurostimulation techniques, utilizing specific
        frequencies and patterns to selectively inhibit synaptic connections associated with designated memories.</p>
    <p>This process, controlled through the secure smartphone app, triggers a cascade of neural responses leading to the
        discreet and irreversible erasure of the targeted memory traces. The entire procedure is conducted with
        precision, mitigating any unintended impact on adjacent memories or cognitive functions.</p>

    <h3 class="text-grey">How sharing works</h3>
    <p>The <span class="text-primary">Recollector's</span> memory retrieval process is an orchestrated interplay between
        neural stimulation and immersive sensory feedback. Upon selecting a memory through the smartphone app, the
        implanted chip activates targeted neural pathways, inducing a controlled reactivation of the associated sensory
        and emotional experiences.</p>
    <p>Simultaneously, the device interfaces with augmented reality (AR) technologies, overlaying visual and auditory
        components of the stored memory onto the user's current perception. This integrated approach creates a
        multi-sensory, lifelike re-enactment of the chosen memory, allowing users to relive their experiences in
        unprecedented detail and emotional richness.</p>

    <h1 id="risk">Risks and challenges</h1>
    <p>Through our 200 years of collective experience in memory experimentations, we have gathered a lot of precise
        information on our brain.</p>
    <p>We have joined forces with people such has <span class="text-primary">Francis Eustache</span> and <span
            class="text-primary">Eric Kandel</span>, famous researchers in neuroscience
        as well as state-of-the-art companies to provide to you the best product possible.</p>
    <p>Since 2018 and the start of the project, we managed to do all the necessary research and conceptualize the chip
        entirely so more than half of the work is already done.</p>
    <p>All Tiers items will be available for the backers only and will never be available elsewhere. We also do not plan
        to have any version for sale elsewhere before 2028, and when that happens, the sale prices will be higher than
        here.</p>

    <h1 id="timeline">Timeline</h1>

    <h3 class="text-grey">2018 - Today</h3>
